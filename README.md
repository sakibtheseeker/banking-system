# Banking Management System Using Java AWT and Advanced Data Structures

This project implements a **Banking Management System** with a graphical user interface built using **Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)**. It integrates advanced data structures like **LinkedList**, **Map**, and **AVL Tree** to efficiently manage banking operations such as account creation, transactions, and user management.

## 🚀 Features and Functionalities

### 1. Admin Module
- **Create Account:** Admins can create new customer accounts by entering user details.
- **Delete Account:** Admins can delete existing customer accounts securely.
- **Search Account:** Fast search functionality using account parameters.
- **Edit Account:** Update or correct user account information as needed.

### 2. Staff Module
- **Account Information Retrieval:** Staff can view customer account details for service purposes.
- **Cash Deposit and Withdrawal:** Perform real-time transactions and balance updates.
- **User Logs:** Access transaction histories and user activity logs for monitoring.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights

### Data Structures Used
- **LinkedList:**  
  Maintains sequential transaction logs and user activities efficiently.
- **Map:**  
  Maps account numbers to user data for quick retrieval and updates.
- **AVL Tree:**  
  Maintains a balanced structure for optimized searching, insertion, and deletion of accounts.

### Java AWT
- Provides an interactive, user-friendly GUI for managing all banking operations.

## 📚 Significance
This project demonstrates the practical application of **advanced data structures** to solve real-world banking problems. It offers:
- Fast and reliable performance.
- Scalable design suitable for small to medium-sized banking operations.
- A strong foundation for learning both **data structure algorithms** and **GUI-based application development** in Java.
